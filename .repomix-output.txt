<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /

A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

<file path=".git_disabled/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample">
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   - Note: Some warnings about engine compatibility were observed but did not affect the build

5. **Fix Code Issues**
   - Fixed WebSocketEvents import issue in OrderService.ts
   - Changed import from WebSocketEvents to WebSocketEventType

6. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Build completed successfully
   - Note: Some chunks larger than 500KB (consider code splitting in future)

7. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/admin
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/admin
   ```

8. **Configure Permissions**
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/admin
   ```

9. **Reload Server**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload caddy
   ```

10. **Verify Deployment**
    - Check Caddy status
    - Verify application accessibility

### Common Issues and Solutions
- If changes not reflected, verify file timestamps and redeploy
- Check Caddy logs for any serving issues
- Ensure proper file permissions

### Deployment Verification
- Access the application at cms.inseat.achievengine.com
- Verify all features are working as expected
- Monitor for any console errors

# INSEAT-Admin Frontend Project Structure &amp; Development Guide

This document outlines the structure, technologies, and development process for the INSEAT-Admin frontend application.

## Core Technologies

*   **Framework/Library:** React
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **UI Library:** Material UI (MUI)
*   **Routing:** React Router (`react-router-dom`)
*   **HTTP Client:** Axios
*   **State Management:** React Context API (for Auth, Preferences) and Redux/Sagas (intended for complex state like live orders). Note: RBAC context (`RbacContext.tsx`) and Live Order/WebSocket related files (`redux/`, `sagas/`, `services/websocketService.ts`) exist but may not be fully implemented or functional.

## Project Structure (`src/`)

The `src/` directory follows a standard feature-based structure:

1.  **Core Setup (`main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `index.css`, `App.css`):**
    *   `main.tsx`: Application entry point, renders `App`.
    *   `App.tsx`: Root component, sets up context providers, routing, and renders the main `Layout`.
    *   `index.css`, `App.css`: Global and base application styles.

2.  **Routing (`routes.tsx`):**
    *   Defines all application routes using `react-router-dom`, mapping URL paths to page components. Crucial for adding new sections. Uses lazy loading for components.

3.  **Layout (`components/Layout.tsx`):**
    *   Defines the overall UI structure (sidebar, header, main content area).
    *   Contains the sidebar navigation logic (often driven by a configuration array like `categories`). Updates for new features are made here.

4.  **Components (`components/`):**
    *   **Feature-Specific (e.g., `restaurants/`, `menus/`, `tables/`, `Category/`):** Contain components related to specific data entities.
        *   `...List.tsx`: Displays lists of items (e.g., `RestaurantList.tsx`), often using `common/DataTable.tsx`. Includes view/edit/delete actions.
        *   `...Form.tsx`: Handles *both* creating and editing items (e.g., `AddRestaurant.tsx`, `MenuForm.tsx`). Uses route parameters (`useParams`) to determine mode (add vs. edit). Fetches data in edit mode, calls create/update API on submit.
        *   `...Detail.tsx`: Shows detailed information for a single item (e.g., `RestaurantDetail.tsx`).
    *   **Common (`common/`):** Reusable UI elements (e.g., `DataTable.tsx`, `ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `LogoutButton.tsx`).
    *   **Specialized (`analytics/`, `rbac/`, `settings/`):** Components for specific functional areas.

5.  **Pages (`pages/`):**
    *   Top-level components representing distinct views, directly linked in `routes.tsx` (e.g., `Login.tsx`, `MenuItems/MenuItemDetail.tsx`).

6.  **Services (`services/`):**
    *   Modules encapsulating API calls for specific resources (e.g., `RestaurantService.ts`, `MenuService.ts`).
    *   Use a configured `axios` instance (`utils/axiosConfig.ts`).
    *   Provide methods for CRUD operations (e.g., `getRestaurants`, `createRestaurant`).

7.  **State Management:**
    *   **Context API (`context/`):** For global state (Auth, Preferences, RBAC).
    *   **Redux (`redux/`, `sagas/`):** For more complex state, potentially async operations (WebSockets).

8.  **Hooks (`hooks/`):**
    *   Custom React Hooks for reusable logic (e.g., `usePermission.ts`).

9.  **Types (`types/`):**
    *   TypeScript interfaces and type definitions for data structures.

10. **Utilities (`utils/`):**
    *   Helper functions (API config, formatting, validation).

11. **Styling (`styles/`, `theme/`):**
    *   CSS files and theme configuration.

## Adding a New Feature (Example: "Discounts")

1.  **Backend:** Ensure API endpoints for Discounts exist.
2.  **Service (`services/DiscountService.ts`):** Create a new service file with methods (`getDiscounts`, `createDiscount`, `updateDiscount`, etc.) using `axios`.
3.  **Types (`types/discountTypes.ts` or `types/index.ts`):** Define the `Discount` interface.
4.  **Components (`components/discounts/`):**
    *   `DiscountList.tsx`: Fetch and display discounts using `DiscountService` and `DataTable`. Include action buttons.
    *   `DiscountForm.tsx`: Create a form for discount details. Use `useParams` to check for an ID (edit mode). Fetch data if editing. Call `createDiscount` or `updateDiscount` on submit.
    *   `DiscountDetail.tsx` (Optional): Display read-only details.
5.  **Pages (Optional):** Create a page component if needed (e.g., `pages/DiscountsPage.tsx`).
6.  **Routing (`routes.tsx`):** Add new `<Route>` entries mapping paths like `/discounts`, `/discounts/new`, `/discounts/:id/edit` to the corresponding components, likely wrapped in `<ProtectedRoute>`.
7.  **Navigation (`components/Layout.tsx`):** Modify the sidebar configuration array (e.g., the `categories` array) to add a new menu item linking to `/discounts`.

This structured approach ensures consistency and maintainability as the application grows.

## Current Implementation Status

*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** While context (`RbacContext.tsx`) and related components/hooks exist, the full functionality might not be implemented or integrated with the backend `auth-service`.
*   **Live Orders / WebSockets:** Redux slices (`orderSlice.ts`), sagas (`orderSagas.ts`, `websocketSagas.ts`), and services (`websocketService.ts`) related to live order updates via WebSockets are present, but the end-to-end functionality is likely incomplete.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```
