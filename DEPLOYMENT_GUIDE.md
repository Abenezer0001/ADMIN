# INSEAT Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the INSEAT applications to both staging and production environments using GitHub Actions.

## üìã Overview

The INSEAT project consists of two main applications:
- **INSEAT Customer** (`inseat-customer`): Customer-facing menu application

Both applications use GitHub Actions for automated deployment to staging and production environments.
